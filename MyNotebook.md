# Arithmetic Expression Examples

In this section, we will demonstrate basic arithmetic expressions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These expressions are fundamental in many programming tasks.

Here are some common examples:





```python
# Multiplying and adding numbers

# Define the numbers
a = 5
b = 3

# Multiply the numbers
multiplication_result = a * b

# Add the numbers
addition_result = a + b

# Display the results
multiplication_result, addition_result
